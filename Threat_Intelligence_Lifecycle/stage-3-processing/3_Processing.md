## Stage 3: Processing

### Purpose
Transform collected data into a usable format by removing noise and standardizing inputs.


### Case Study: Healthcare Organization

The collected data from various tools came in different formats (JSON, CSV, plain text). 
They implemented a Python script to normalize these feeds into STIX format and applied deduplication rules.
This helped avoid alert fatigue in downstream systems like the SIEM and ensured faster triage by analysts.
