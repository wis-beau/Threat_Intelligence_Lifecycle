### Case Study: Healthcare Organization
A mid-sized healthcare organization analyzed past incidents and found that 80% were phishing-related.

This stage led them to prioritize email-based Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) instead of collecting generic threat feeds.

### Scoping Questions
- What assets are most valuable?
- What types of threats have impacted us?
- Are there known threat actors targeting our industry?
